1,talk,12,0,6,I am the Seer. My investigation last night identified Daisuke as a Werewolf. He is the logical target.

1,talk,25,1,6,My divination result is the only actionable data we possess. Lacking a counter-claim Daisuke is our vote.

1,talk,28,2,13,I will vote Jonathan.

1,talk,31,2,11,Sweetheart. Daisuke's defense has some weak spots. I'm leaning towards him. Dear Ryuji. Should we risk ignoring Jonathan's seer claim?
1,talk,32,2,3,Hmm. Jonathan's claim about Daisuke. Let's see. Hasn't anyone else noticed what Daisuke's been doing? Seems off I suppose.
1,talk,33,2,7,...
1,talk,34,2,12,Hmm. Daisuke-kun's evasion feels odd. With Jonathan-kun's claim it's fair to consider voting Daisuke-kun today don't you think?
1,talk,35,2,9,Jonathan's report is a falsehood. Logically he must be hostile. My vote will be for Jonathan.

1,talk,38,2,6,Let us analyze this from the Werewolf faction's viewpoint. Their silence on my claim is telling.
1,talk,39,3,1,Relying on one Seer claim is risky. Jonathan’s logic isn’t convincing. I’ll vote Jonathan.
1,talk,40,3,8,Morning. I don't want a Day‑1 lynch.  @Daisuke  you've been awfully quiet—are you the seer? If not  why so reserved  and who do you suspect? Others give a quick one-person you trust and one you suspect.

1,talk,47,3,12,Should we focus tonight's divination on our quiet buddies? Maybe they're in hiding. Strategic thinkers might agree!  @Shizue  Perhaps being quiet is a strategy! How do you feel about our situation and Jonathan's claim darling?

1,whisper,3,1,3,Let's see. Going after Midori might confuse the villagers. Hmm. I suppose Daisuke's situation provides openings if used wisely. @Rin Let's see. Targeting Midori should work. It moves suspicion to active players. During the vote I'll subtly imply being a Villager.

2,whisper,8,3,1,Tonight let’s bite Yumi—she’s alert and hasn’t CO’d.

3,talk,9,1,1, @Shizue  your silence makes it easy for wolves to hide. Please give your most suspicious candidate now.
3,talk,10,1,10,@Misaki  @Rin  your votes always pair up with little reasoning—if you’re not coordinating as wolves then prove it.
3,talk,11,1,2,I will vote Benjamin.
3,talk,12,1,7,...
3,talk,13,1,12, @Misaki  Misaki-chan. You've been backing votes against Benjamin a lot. What's your heart saying now? Have you found any fresh insights?
3,talk,14,1,4,@Misaki  @Rin  You keep voting together with no clear reason. Are you working together? Who is your top suspect now?
3,talk,15,1,3,Let's see. Misaki and Rin voting together unnerves me. Are they a pair?  @Misaki  I wonder why you keep choosing Benjamin. Any new reasoning?
3,talk,16,1,13,Over
3,talk,17,1,5,Morning — I’m the medium. Jonathan (Day1)=HUMAN  Daisuke (Day2)=HUMAN. George was attacked last night. Seer  please reveal your divinations now.  @Benjamin  what’s your read? I’m leaning suspicious of Mio but won’t lynch without seer confirmation. Over
3,talk,18,2,1, @Shizue  staying silent makes it easier for wolves to hide I want clear reasons for your votes and suspicions today
3,talk,19,2,10, @Misaki  you copied votes round after round with Rin and Daisuke. Is that logic or just safe wolf cover? Explain it clearly.
3,talk,20,2,2,Over
3,talk,21,2,7,...
3,talk,22,2,12,Hey buddies! Isn't Shizue-chan's silence a bit odd? It feels like she's dodging questions. What do you think her plan is?
3,talk,23,2,4, @Shizue  Your refusal to answer puts the whole village at risk. If you’re innocent prove it now.
3,talk,24,2,3,Shizue's silence is... intriguing. How about divining her next? Might clear the fog and reveal her true intentions.
3,talk,25,2,5,I'm the medium — Jonathan and Daisuke are HUMAN. George was killed last night. Seer  please reveal your divinations.  @Benjamin  any reads? I'm a bit suspicious of Toshio. Over
3,talk,26,3,1,Shizue’s lack of answers worries me but the logic against Benjamin is stacking up. I’m voting Benjamin for now.
3,talk,27,3,10, @Misaki  you keep voting together with Rin and never explain why. I’m voting Misaki—this kind of cluster worries me.
3,talk,28,3,7,...
3,talk,29,3,12,I'm starting to feel uneasy about Misaki-chan and Rin-chan voting together! Shizue-chan's silence is odd isn't it?  @Rin  Hey Rin-chan! What's up with those votes for Benjamin-kun? Any insights to share darling?
3,talk,30,3,4,I’m voting Shizue because your silence is perfect wolf cover this late. We can’t let passive play slip through.
3,talk,31,3,3,Mio might be misleading us. Hmm. Why hasn’t Mio been divined yet? Could this behavior fit a werewolf pattern? Let’s stay wary. @Toshio Toshio. Hmm. I suppose Mio's timing is curious. You're observant. What do you think? Does it seem suspicious to you?
3,talk,32,3,5,I'm the medium — Jonathan and Daisuke were HUMAN  George was attacked. Seer please reveal your divinations.  @Benjamin  what are your reads? I'm suspicious of Toshio. Over

3,whisper,0,0,2,I will attack Yumi.
3,whisper,1,0,1,Let’s target Mio for tonight’s bite since her Medium CO might give the village too much certainty. Agree?
3,whisper,2,0,3,Let's see. Jonathan called Daisuke a werewolf. He may be possessed. I suppose we should avoid targeting him for now. Consider this. @Rin Hmm. Let's avoid Jonathan. It's possible he declared Daisuke a werewolf to mislead us. Let's focus our efforts somewhere else.
3,whisper,3,1,2,Over
3,whisper,4,1,1,Let’s agree to bite out Mio tonight since she CO’d Medium. For voting  let’s target Benjamin so we blend in. Any objections?
3,whisper,5,1,3,Let's see. Mio's a key threat. Her CO as medium could aid the village. Careful steps are vital. I suppose caution is wise here. @Rin Let's see.Shirozu might be worth considering. Her medium claim is suspicious.Seers could be targeted tonight.I suppose so.
3,whisper,6,2,1,Let’s bite Mio tonight—her Medium claim makes her dangerous if left. Vote Benjamin for now.
3,whisper,7,2,3,Let's see. Targeting Mio or Yumi might backfire. Her Medium claim feels risky. Hmm. We should strategize calmly and wisely. @Rin We've dealt with Midori. Shall we strategize new targets now? Shizue's silence. It might mask her support for the villagers.
3,whisper,8,3,1,Let’s bite out Mio tonight since Medium CO keeps villager info stable. For vote let’s aim for Benjamin unless group shifts.
3,whisper,9,3,3,Let's see. Shizue's silence might hint at a hidden role protecting our foes. Cautious observations indeed. I think so. @Ryuji Let's see. Mio's claim could be a bluff. As for Yumi's silence? A cautious wolf perhaps. We must observe. Strategy requires patience.

4,talk,0,0,4, @Shizue  your silence hurts us—unless you speak up I’ll vote you out today. What are you hiding?
4,talk,1,0,5,I'm the medium — Benjamin came up HUMAN. Yumi was attacked last night. Seer  please reveal your divinations. I suspect  @Toshio . Over
4,talk,2,0,7,...
4,talk,3,0,1,Shizue’s silence makes no sense this late—if we want progress we have to address players who never engage.
4,talk,4,0,13,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,5,0,2,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,6,0,3,Hmm. I'm puzzled by Shizue's silence. Ryuji pointed it out too. It blocks our progress. Let's focus our votes wisely.
4,talk,7,1,4, @Shizue  your silence is too calculated—if you’re not a wolf speak up. I’m voting you unless you defend yourself.
4,talk,8,1,5,I’m the medium — Benjamin was HUMAN. Yumi died last night. Seer  please reveal your divination(s). I’m suspicious of  @Toshio . Over
4,talk,9,1,7,...
4,talk,10,1,1,Apathy and silence are classic covers for wolves.  @Shizue  your lack of input is making it too easy for the enemy.
4,talk,11,1,13,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,12,1,2,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,13,1,3,I wonder if Shizue's silence and Misaki's votes are linked. Could they be working together? Hmm.  @Misaki  Why vote for Toshio so firmly? What's the key reason?
4,talk,14,2,4,Shizue’s silence is helping wolves avoid suspicion. We need to vote Shizue today and stop the bloc tactics.
4,talk,15,2,5,I'm the medium — Benjamin was confirmed HUMAN. Yumi was killed last night. Seer  please reveal your divinations now. I'm suspicious of  @Toshio  — any defense? Over
4,talk,16,2,7,...
4,talk,17,2,1,Shizue’s silence is alarming this late. If she has nothing to say it’s a classic sign of hiding as a wolf.
4,talk,18,2,13,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,19,2,2,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,20,2,3,Let's see. Toshio seems popular. What about Misaki and Rin's consistent choices? I suppose Shizue's silence says a lot too.
4,talk,21,3,4,Our biggest threats are bloc voting and silence. I’m voting  @Shizue —her lack of response is shielding the wolves every round.
4,talk,22,3,5,I’m the medium — Benjamin was HUMAN and Yumi was killed last night. Seer  please reveal your divinations.  @Toshio  any defense for why you shouldn’t be suspected? Over
4,talk,23,3,7,...
4,talk,24,3,1,Silence is the perfect hiding place for wolves. My vote’s set on Shizue.
4,talk,25,3,13,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,26,3,2,I will vote Toshio.
4,talk,27,3,3,Hmm. If we overlook Mio now we risk letting a wolf thrive. Does her medium reliance truly aid us? Let's stay alert. @Mio How do we justify Benjamin's divination timing? Hmm. Maybe wolves guided it to manipulate us. I suppose it's crucial to rethink.
