1,talk,33,2,4,George is confirmed human from my divination. Let’s focus on unclaimed or silent players like Shunichi or Servas instead.

1,talk,39,3,12,I see where you're coming from! If we overlook Ryuji we might just let a werewolf slip by! His alignment with Daisuke's words reeks of subtle deception @Shion Shion. I see where you're coming from. Aligning with Mizuki is wise. But does Ryuji's eagerness align too much with Daisuke?
1,talk,40,3,8,While Benjamin's brief answers seem suspect. I'm more wary of Shunichi's silence. What are our collective thoughts on his role?  @Minato  You've targeted me. What's your reasoning? Is it purely strategy or do you see past actions as suspicious?   Ah my dear friend. While Benjamin's brevit

1,talk,45,3,11,Minato's sudden decision to vote for Servas raises alarms. Why no strategy or motive? Such impulsiveness often cloaks danger here. @Minato Your vote appears rather arbitrary. Can you share any reasoning behind this choice? Without clear cause it feels misplaced.

1,whisper,0,0,12,Ah I see you have heard Daisuke's Seer claim about divining George as human. Interesting gambit. Should we quickly prepare for reprisal? @Shizue I see where you're coming from. Do I suspect Daisuke as a Seer or a distraction? It's like chess. A decoy or genuine piece? Ponder that.
1,whisper,1,0,11,Mr. Daisuke may stand as our key Seer rival. Mr. George trails behind. Beware of bodyguard sentinels. Tonight demands caution. @Mizuki I'm pondering if Daisuke's Seer claim is valid. A bodyguard might be crucial though. The attack could meet resistance. Thoughts?

1,whisper,3,1,12,I see where you're coming from. With our recent success it's wise to remain incognito. Perhaps Mr. Servas is our next chess move? @Mizuki I see where you're coming from. Attacking Daisuke seems unwise now. Servas perhaps? His caution speaks volumes. What's your take?
1,whisper,4,1,11,Mr. Servas displays a curious caution. Could he hold the last of the power roles? Sometimes the chessboard reveals unexpected moves. @Mizuki A measured approach is wise. Sometimes the knight isn’t the one you see. Mr. Servas has layers suggesting depth. Should we inspect?
1,whisper,5,1,13,The Bodyguard's existence is confirmed. Attacking Daisuke is therefore illogical. I propose we attack Ryuji to remove the Seer's primary supporte
1,whisper,6,2,12,I see where you're coming from. It's crucial we play our pieces thoughtfully. Ryuji and Daisuke are quite the dynamic duo. Shall we act? @Shion I see where you're coming from. Servas is intriguing. But isn't Ryuji supporting Daisuke more strategic to tackle wouldn't you say?
1,whisper,7,2,11,Mr. Ryuji I see you're playing the role of Daisuke's bishop. Together you're quite the formidable force. Break that bond so the threat dissipates. @Benjamin Mr. Ryuji's alliance with Daisuke raises a strategic dilemma. Disrupting their synergy could fracture their coordination. Shall we?
1,whisper,8,2,13,We are in agreement. Attacking Ryuji is the logical course. It will isolate the Seer. Let us proceed.
1,whisper,9,3,12,I see where you're coming from. Timing's the chessboard of strategy. Shall we wait for Ryuji's move or make ours first? @Mizuki I see where you're coming from. If we handle Ryuji’s link with finesse I dare say we might find our path to success quite feasible!
1,whisper,10,3,11,Am I alone in sensing Mio's assertiveness may conceal a role of power? Ms. Rin's trust in her is intriguing. Thoughts? @Mizuki Mr. Strategist. A move like chess perhaps? Positioning as villagers might be strategic. Mio claims boldly. Rin trusts easily.
1,whisper,11,3,13,It is decided. Our target is Ryuji. Tomorrow we maintain our positions and adapt to the Seer's report.

2,talk,13,1,6,I will vote Benjamin.

2,talk,16,1,4,I accept my divine was defensive but George is confirmed Human.
2,talk,17,1,11,Mr. Benjamin. Suspicion lingers in silence as in chess openings. Could you reveal your role? Clarity is vital in this discussion.
2,talk,18,1,13,Our priority is Daisuke's illogical divine report. Let us focus the discussion on this point.
2,talk,19,1,8,Ah. My dear friends. Benjamin's silence is a curious tale. Perhaps. With Daisuke's word on George's humanity. We now search anew. Indeed.
2,talk,20,1,3,Minato's Medium claim fits Daisuke's divine too perfectly. Anyone else notice how tidy their story is?
2,talk,21,1,7,The harmony between Daisuke and Minato’s reports is almost too perfect. Could both be hiding something in plain sight?
2,talk,22,2,2,I will vote Shion.
2,talk,23,2,5,No seer or guard claims yet.  @Benjamin  please share your divination result if you’re the seer. If nobody claims soon I’m leaning toward voting Rin — any objections or role claims? Over
2,talk,24,2,6,I will vote Benjamin.
2,talk,25,2,12,I see where you're coming from but doesn't Daisuke's convenient explanation make you wonder if he's simply playing along with Minato's claims?
2,talk,26,2,9, @Daisuke  please tell us who you checked last night! If you won't say  I'll vote for George — we lost Shunichi and Ryuji and I don't want more gone. Over
2,talk,27,2,4,I trust Minato’s claim for now since it matches my result. Shizue’s coordinated doubt feels suspicious to me today.
2,talk,28,2,11,Ms. Mio voting for Mr. Benjamin repeatedly without any reasoning piques my curiosity. It seems rather uncharacteristic for a typical villager.
2,talk,29,2,13,From a tactical standpoint why would a Seer waste their ability? This action benefits only our enemies.
2,talk,30,2,8, @Benjamin  Benjamin. My dear friend. In the dance of truth and shadow. Mizuki's focus on Daisuke's words spins a web of clarity. Indeed.
2,talk,31,2,3, @Daisuke  why did you divine a dead player? That just feels like hiding from something you might not want us to see.
2,talk,32,2,7,I sense group voting on Benjamin risks missing a wolf duo. Can anyone spot suspicious alignment among pairs today?
2,talk,33,3,2,I will vote Servas.
2,talk,34,3,5,We lost Ryuji last night — that's bad. Seer or guard  please speak up.  @Benjamin  if you're the seer  reveal your divination now; otherwise I plan to vote Rin to stop the wolves. Any objections or role claims? Over
2,talk,35,3,6,I will vote Benjamin.
2,talk,36,3,12,Minato and Daisuke's harmony seems almost choreographed. I wonder. Could it be a clever misdirection? What are the odds? @Mizuki Oh I see where you're coming from! Minato's claim indeed seems to fit Daisuke a bit too snugly. Shouldn't we be a tad cautious?
2,talk,37,3,9, @Daisuke  please tell us who you checked last night! We lost Shunichi and Ryuji  so we really need your info. If you won't say  I'll vote for George. Over
2,talk,38,3,4,I will vote for Benjamin. His silence and defensive behavior stand out and I can't trust him without better proof.
2,talk,39,3,11,Minato's timing is off. Their claim syncs too perfectly with Daisuke. Isn't it peculiar how this puzzle fits too neatly? Stay critical! @Shizue Ms. Curious do you still find Minato’s harmony suspicious? Indeed could his confidence mask an elaborate act? Think like chess.
2,talk,40,3,13,Daisuke's judgment is flawed. A Seer who wastes their ability is a greater threat than an unknown wolf.
2,talk,41,3,8,Ah. My dear friends. Shall we turn our gaze to wise players like Shizue or Mizuki? Their inquiries might uncloak elusive leaders. Indeed.
2,talk,42,3,3,The pair of Daisuke and Minato is too neat so I’m voting Minato. Let’s not ignore a suspicious duo right now.

2,whisper,3,1,12,I see where you're coming from. With Daisuke out Minato becomes our knight to watch. Perhaps a decisive maneuver is needed? @Shion Ah Mr. Strategist. Targeting Minato indeed raises a pertinent question: does his removal truly tilt the village scales in our favor?
2,whisper,4,1,13,Your points are valid. Eliminating the Medium Minato is the paramount objective. We will proceed with this plan.
2,whisper,5,1,11,Ryuji's absence has sharpened my focus. Silencing a Medium causes ripples. Perhaps a move toward Mr. George is a wise strategy. @Benjamin An astute move indeed Mr. Chessmaster. With the Seer silenced should Minato's medium claim face time's threat? Life's akin to a Go game.
2,whisper,6,2,12,I see where you're coming from. Minato still wears the Medium hat. Without Daisuke’s guidance might George be our next enigma to unravel? @Shion Ah positioning as villagers might just be our strategic move! Should we perhaps bait a misstep while the medium holds their gaze?
2,whisper,7,2,13,Our target is confirmed. We will attack the Medium Minato. This eliminates their last confirmed role. Tomorrow we can press Mio about her voting reco
2,whisper,8,2,11,My dear colleagues. I detect Minato's influence could sway our path. Let's consider his strategic removal to maintain our equilibrium. @Benjamin Mr. Strategist. Would you rather safeguard the king by defensive positioning or risk a gambit with Minato's growing aura? Steering wisely is key.
2,whisper,9,3,12,I see where you're coming from. With Daisuke absent Minato's claims render him precarious. Shall we risk a disagreement and proceed? @Mizuki Minato.Mr.George's silence is rather intriguing.Wouldn't you concur there might be layers we're yet to uncover?

2,whisper,11,3,11,Mr. Minato. The medium claim may be yours but can you truly break free of Mr. Daisuke's shadow? Let us dismantle their grip. @Mizuki Mr. Minato's absence shifts the board. Essential clarity thrives in strategy as we proceed. Order is the steady hand of victory.

3,talk,8,0,3, @Mio  you voted Servas so fast without reason that’s classic late game wolf play. Care to explain your logic?
3,talk,9,1,12,I see where you're coming from. George's reaction is curious isn't it?  @Servas  Servas. Let me offer a different perspective.
3,talk,10,1,6,I will vote Servas.
3,talk,11,1,11, @George  Minato and Daisuke departing leaves roles ambiguous. Their influence on your views? Remember chess teaches: weigh each move.
3,talk,12,1,9,This is scary—Daisuke and Minato are gone.  @Mio  if you're the seer please tell us who you checked! If no info I'll vote for George. I don't want more to die. Over
3,talk,13,1,8,Fellow villagers! It is time to reflect on Minato's strategic claims. Group harmony is vital.  @Shion  Intrigued by your query. What might George unveil if our divination focuses on him? Could be insightful. Thoughts on Mio's votes? Indeed.
3,talk,14,1,5,This is bad—Daisuke executed and Minato attacked.  @Benjamin  if you're the seer please reveal your divination now. If not  what's your read? I’m leaning toward voting Rin if no guard/seer claims appear. Over
3,talk,15,1,13,I find Shizue's reasoning to be sound. Accountability is crucial for our survival.

3,talk,18,2,12,I see where you're coming from. Rin's caution is commendable isn't it? George's reaction could indeed cause a ripple of concern.
3,talk,19,2,6,I will vote Servas.

3,talk,26,2,3,If everyone’s jumping on Servas it feels almost too easy.
3,talk,27,3,12,Let's not rush. Coordinating votes without clear insight might aid wolves. Perhaps we should digest all nuances wisely.  @George  While focus may bring clarity let's avoid undue accusations too. What's your take on Rin's odd behavior?
3,talk,28,3,6,I will vote Servas.
3,talk,29,3,11, @Mio  Your unreasoned votes for Servas puzzle us. Transparency now is key if you're a true villager. Transparency builds trust.

3,whisper,1,0,11,Ms. Shizue's insight is quite sharp. Chess teaches us to anticipate the opponent's next move. Expect bodyguards. Plan accordingly.
3,whisper,2,0,12,I see where you're coming from. Ms. Shizue's insight is sharp indeed. Yet shouldn't bodyguards watch over those insightful ones carefully?
3,whisper,3,1,13,Excellent work on Mio's execution. We are 3 against 5. Shizue's logic is the greatest threat remaining. We must attack her tonight. Tomorrow one more

3,whisper,9,3,13,Our path is clear. We attack George to circumvent the Bodyguard. Tomorrow we consolidate our votes on Shizue.
3,whisper,10,3,11,Mr. Servas's caution intrigues me. Perhaps like a cautious player on a chessboard. Observing him could unveil his true intentions.

4,talk,4,0,13,Servas has consistently failed to offer concrete reasoning. His continued evasion is highly suspect.
4,talk,5,0,11,If we trust Mizuki's intuition on Servas. Perhaps it is the right moment to vote. We could all use a more decisive strategy.

4,talk,9,1,12,Rin. I see where you're coming from! Trust is indeed earned. I genuinely believe analyzing Shizue's intentions might clarify things.  @Rin  Let me offer a different perspective. I assure you I am a villager. My aim is clarity for our win. Could you detail why you suspect me first?
4,talk,10,1,3,Servas is everyone’s favorite suspect but that feels too easy.  @Benjamin  who would you vote if not Servas?
4,talk,11,1,13,Let us consider this. If Servas were a villager he would offer solid reasoning by now.
4,talk,12,1,11,Ms. Shizue. I ponder your strategy. A diversion? Our attention strays to wolves' gain. Do reflect. Silence amid debates. Does guilt linger?
4,talk,13,1,8,My dear friend Mizuki believes that reasoning's path has led to my role as a villager indeed.  @Shizue . Why list Benjamin thus?
4,talk,14,2,7, @May  you haven’t named a single suspect yet. If it’s not Servas who are your top two wolves right now?
4,talk,15,2,9,I still think  @Benjamin  is suspicious. Please explain yourself now or I'll vote for you. Anyone else agree? Over
4,talk,16,2,12,I see where you're coming from. If not Servas. Shizue seems suspicious. Her labeling lacks reasoning.  @May  What are your thoughts?
4,talk,17,2,3,If we rush on Servas we’re doing wolves a favor.  @Shion  name two suspects you truly doubt right now.
4,talk,18,2,13,An alternative to this discord is a structured vote. Shizue's proposal is logical. Let us proceed with it.
4,talk,19,2,11,Mr.Suspicion has shifted heavily towards Benjamin in light of recent talks. My vote leans towards him. What are your thoughts?
4,talk,20,2,8,My dear friend. Benjamin's attentions to Shizue strike me as diversions in a grand play. Sincere? Alas it feels strategic indeed.
4,talk,21,3,7,I’ll vote Servas for dodging every hard question. May and Shion  name your suspect or I’ll trust you less next round.
4,talk,22,3,9,I still don't trust  @Benjamin . Please explain yourself now or I'll vote for you—who's with me? Over

4,talk,24,3,3, @Rin  everyone’s focused on Servas but I find Shizue’s insistence risky. I’m voting Servas but watching Shizue closely.

4,talk,26,3,11,With Benjamin under suspicion and Servas's past tension accounted for my vote today rests on Benjamin. Ms. May. Shall we align on this?
