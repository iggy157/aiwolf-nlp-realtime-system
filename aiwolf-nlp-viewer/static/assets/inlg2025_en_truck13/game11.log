1,talk,1,0,7,Good morning. I still have no special info. We lost Benjamin — I hope he wasn't a seer.  @Asuka  if you are seer please share any result  or at least tell us who you suspect. I'm uneasy about Shizue; she pushed hard for Benjamin. Quick one-line reads

1,talk,5,0,12,Hey darling! I'm super curious why Asuka chose Sakura! Are there any cool observations you've got? Votes should be well thought out right?

1,talk,7,0,5,Hey buddy! Voting's no fun without a splash of reason! What do you say Asuka? Why am I fishy huh? Let's dig for clues together!
1,talk,8,0,11,Asuka your accusation lacks foundation. A Seer should present their findings before we proceed.
1,talk,9,0,2,I divined Benjamin and maybe... he's a Werewolf. I wonder if we should consider him for today's vote buddy. What do you think?
1,talk,10,0,13,Minato says Benjamin is wolf. Why you point at Sakura  @Asuka ? You distract the pack.

1,talk,16,1,3, @Minato  you claim Seer and named Benjamin as wolf—why pick him for divination? Let’s hear your logic before we vote.
1,talk,17,1,10,Interesting Minato would choose me as first divination target. That feels like a calculated wolf move not real Seer logic.
1,talk,18,1,12,Sounds like Minato might be our seer if he's right about divining you! We should be cautious buddy.  @Benjamin  You're feeling wolf vibes?
1,talk,19,1,4, @Minato  if no one else COs seer then Benjamin is most suspicious now. Anyone want to counterclaim or oppose?
1,talk,20,1,5,Hey buddies! Mr. Minato said Benjamin's a wolf after divining. I'll wait for you both to share! Ms. Minato. Why Benjamin first?
1,talk,21,1,11,Minato's claim is noted. His choice of Benjamin as a divine target however lacks a clear rationale.
1,talk,22,1,2,I think maybe for tonight's divine we should focus on Rin or Victoria. Benjamin's role seems clear don't you think?

1,talk,31,2,12,Hey darlings! I'm kinda thinking Benjamin might be a bit sus. Minato's divination seems so true. What are your thoughts buddies?
1,talk,32,2,4,Minato CO’d seer and named Benjamin as wolf. Unless someone else claims seer shouldn’t we vote Benjamin today?
1,talk,33,2,5,Hey buddies! Minato played seer and spotted Benjamin as a wolf! Maybe it's a good idea to join in this time! What do you all think?

1,talk,44,3,12,Minato's seer claim is awesome! Let's trust him and vote Benjamin wisely. Hey Jonny what's up with Asuka's voting swaps? Puzzling!
1,talk,45,3,4,Given Minato’s seer claim naming Benjamin a wolf with no counterclaim I’ll vote Benjamin. Let’s work together today.

2,talk,17,1,4, @Victoria  your voting makes no sense and you avoid explaining. Right now you seem most wolf-like.

2,talk,20,1,2,I wonder about Victoria's vote changes. Maybe it's a bit odd? She's switching targets without reasons and that's troublesome I think.

2,talk,42,3,2,I wonder if Victoria’s changing votes are a wolf tactic. Maybe we should trust my seer claim and focus on her this round.

3,talk,15,1,4,George keeps going after Shizue even after two wolves were confirmed.
3,talk,16,1,13,Minato saw Asuka is human. But she moves with wolves. She is bad human. I hunt Asuka today.
3,talk,17,1,12,Minato's vision is still strong huh? With Victoria in the mix we're hunting Asuka next? Her moves are so sketchy! Yaay! You know  @George  you've been super tough on Shizue. Since Minato's claim got confirmed don't you think it's time to focus on the others? What's your take on this buddy?
3,talk,18,2,8,Oh dear—I'm so sad about all these losses.  @Asuka  please tell us your divination result now; we really need guidance. I'm a bit uneasy about Mizuki—she seems very calm. Could everyone give a one-line
3,talk,19,2,3, @George  you keep pushing Shizue despite evidence—give us real reasons or you’ll be my vote today.
3,talk,20,2,11,A confirmed human who creates disarray is a liability. My vote will be for Asuka.
3,talk,21,2,5,With both wolfies Minato divined gone let's skip over to Mizuki! Time to cut down suspect lists by votes! Yay buddy!
3,talk,22,2,6,I will vote Jonathan.
3,talk,23,2,7,We've lost too many.  @Asuka  if you're the seer please reveal your result now. If no claim  I'm inclined to vote Shizue for pushing Benjamin—anyone with stronger reads? One-line o
3,talk,24,2,4, @George  you still target Shizue even after two wolves were found. Why ignore new info? That’s suspicious to me.
3,talk,25,2,13, @George  Spirits say truth. Minatos nose good. Why you hunt Shizue? You help the last wolf.
3,talk,26,2,12,Hmm maybe George is kinda suspicious now? He’s all about Shizue despite Minato's proof huh? What if Jonathan's the werewolf buddy?
3,talk,27,3,8,Oh dear  I'm so saddened by our losses. I'm uneasy about  @Mizuki  — she seems very calm. Could the seer please share their result? If no clear info soon  perhaps we should consider voting for a quiet player. One-line re
3,talk,28,3,3,I’m voting  @George . Stubbornly ignoring confirmed wolves and shifting blame is classic wolf behavior—no more distractions.
3,talk,29,3,11,Though human Asuka's chaotic votes undermine our contract. Her removal is logical.
3,talk,30,3,5,Hey there how about giving Ms. Mizuki a go now? George you're still on Shizue even with Minato’s proofs? Let's explore new paths buddy!
3,talk,31,3,6,I will vote Jonathan.
3,talk,32,3,7,Morning. We're running out of people.  @Asuka  if you're the seer please share any result now — we need guidance. I'm still uneasy about Shizue after how she pushed Benjamin; if no seer speaks up I thi
3,talk,33,3,4,After both wolves were exposed only George kept tunneling old suspicions so I will vote George as the last wolf.
3,talk,34,3,13,Minato saw Asuka is human. But she is bad human. A traitor. I hunt Asuka today.
3,talk,35,3,12,Minato's info is spot on! Let's laser-focus on Asuka! Her chaos is trouble buddy! Jonathan how's your logic game? Let's ace this!

4,talk,6,0,4,Sakura your erratic votes and shifting blame seem suspicious. Please explain your reasoning for targeting me and now Asuka.
4,talk,7,1,11,Asuka's chaos aids our foes as Takumi stated. But Sakura your baseless votes are more suspect.
4,talk,8,1,12,Hey buddies! I'm getting kinda wobbly vibes from Sakura's voting now. Her choices are all over the place which makes me super curious!
4,talk,9,1,3, @Sakura  your voting’s all over the place—give one solid reason or name who you actually suspect right now.
4,talk,10,1,5,Hey buddy! I think Asuka's being a bit of a mystery! Her votes don't match Minato's divination result right? What do you think?
4,talk,11,1,6,I will vote Jonathan.

4,talk,15,2,12,Hey team! I'm a bit worried about Sakura's claim. Minato was right on the money. Should we focus on Jonathan now buddies?
4,talk,16,2,3, @Sakura  your voting never lines up and your logic flips—are you wolf or just reckless? I’m voting you today.
4,talk,17,2,5,Hey friend-o! I'm just a simple villager! With Minato and Takumi's info Asuka seems good. Why's Mizuki jumping so much? Let's focus!  @Mizuki  Hey buddy! Your votes keep changing! What's your main thought about Asuka? Super curious here!

5,talk,1,0,4,Jonathan’s votes have always gone against the facts. If we don’t focus on him now the wolf could win by confusion.
